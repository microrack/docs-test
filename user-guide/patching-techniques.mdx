# Patching Techniques

Explore advanced patching concepts to unlock the full potential of your MICRORACK system.

## Modulation Routing

### Cross-Modulation
Route one oscillator to modulate another for complex harmonic content:

1. Connect VCO1 output to VCO2 FM input
2. Adjust modulation depth with attenuator
3. Experiment with frequency ratios

### Envelope Chaining
Use multiple envelopes for evolving modulation:

- ADSR → Filter cutoff (basic shaping)
- Secondary envelope → VCA (dynamics)
- Inverted envelope → resonance (movement)

## Feedback Loops

Create organic, evolving sounds with controlled feedback:

1. Route VCF output back to its own input (use attenuator!)
2. Add delay or VCA in feedback path
3. Control feedback amount carefully

**Warning**: Start with low feedback levels to avoid harsh sounds or equipment damage.

## Mult and Split Strategies

Efficient signal distribution techniques:

- Use buffered mults for pitch CV
- Passive mults work for most other signals
- Split audio signals for parallel processing

## Advanced CV Techniques

### Offset and Scaling
- Add offset voltages to shift modulation range
- Use VCAs to scale CV amounts dynamically
- Combine multiple CV sources with mixers

### Quantization
- Add quantizers for melodic sequences
- Use sample & hold for stepped modulation
- Combine with random sources for generative patches
