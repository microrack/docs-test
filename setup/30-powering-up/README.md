## Quick Checklist

Before powering on:

- ☐ All modules inserted with **notch at bottom**
- ☐ Power Module firmly seated in power rails
- ☐ Volume turned down on Output Module
- ☐ No loose wires or metal objects on the breadboard
- ☐ Power supply has correct interface (Type-C or DC Jack), voltage rating (5V-12V) and polarity (Center-Positive)

# Powering Up

The Power Module is the fundamental utility module in MICRORACK System. It converts the power from your source to stable voltages required by modules and expands power connection to other breadboards. [More details](../../ecosystem/20-power/)

## Power Supply Options

### Voltage Sources

5V-12V via USB type-C or DC Jack (center-positive)

### Current

Minimum 500mA recommended for small setups

## Connecting the power

1. **Identify the Power Rails:** Most breadboards have two sets of rails on the top and bottom. These will carry the voltages to all your modules.
2. **Insert the Power Module First:** Place the Power Module anywhere on your breadboard. Ensure all pins are firmly seated in the power rails.
3. **Check Orientation:** Ensure the triangular notch is pointing towards you.
4. **Plug your power adapter** into the Power Module.
5. **Check the LEDs:** The Power Module should have indicator LEDs. If they light up, your system is ready!

> **Tip:** One Power Module can power multiple breadboards if they are chained together. See the [Power & Expansion](../../ecosystem/20-power/) section for more details.

## What If Nothing Happens?

- **No LEDs:** Check power supply connection and polarity.
- **Module doesn't work:** Check orientation — notch should be at the bottom.
- **Intermittent power:** Ensure all pins are fully inserted into the breadboard.
