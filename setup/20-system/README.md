## Aligning Modules

Every MICRORACK module has a distinct **triangular cutout (notch)** on the PCB. It helps to orientate modules and properly place them on your breadboard with **notch at the bottom**.

<!-- todo: add long narrow image with cutout orientation example -->

> **FYI:** All MICRORACK modules polarities are protected, so if you accidentally plug a module in backwards  — they simply won't work until you align power rails properly.

## Hot-Swapping

While MICRORACK modules are designed to tolerate hot-swapping **the best practice** is to power off your setup before rearranging.

**It is fine** to carefully insert or remove modules while everything is powered on but requires an extra bit of caution. Check more details in [Hot Swapping](../10-safety#hot-swapping)
