# First Steps

Learn the fundamentals of patching and sound creation with MICRORACK.

## Basic Patching

Connect modules using patch cables to create signal flow:

- **Audio signals**: Connect oscillators to filters to outputs
- **Control voltages**: Use LFOs and envelopes to modulate parameters
- **Gates/Triggers**: Sequence and time events

## Your First Patch

1. Connect VCO output to VCF input
2. Connect VCF output to VCA input
3. Connect VCA output to mixer/output
4. Connect ADSR envelope to VCA CV input
5. Play!

## Tips

- Start simple and add complexity gradually
- Experiment with different signal routings
- Save patches that work well
