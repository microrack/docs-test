## Overview

The MICRORACK Standard defines basic technical specifications for any designers and manufacturers.

MICRORACK specification is designed as an open platform. These specifications ensure interoperability between modules and accessories from different designers and manufacturers.

- [Mechanical Specs](mechanical.md) - Module dimensions, board outlines, power contacts
- [Electrical Specs](electrical.md) - Voltage rails, signal levels, impedance

## Hardware Versioning

Manufacturers, community and MICRORACK team itself may add minor changes and improvements to some module designs over time. For convenience MICRORACK modules are versioned by semver-like increment (e.g. v1.0 -> v1.1) which is placed on the bottom side of the boards.

## Consistent Platform

MICRORACK Platform provides stable design foundation for seamless experience across designs, while building blocks variability grows further enriching your setups.

Version of hardware may be updated and new creative modules and chassis may emerge but system standards remains the same across manufacturers and enthusiasts.
