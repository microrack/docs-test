# VCF — Voltage Controlled Filter

The VCF shapes the harmonic content of audio signals, creating tonal variations from bright to dark and everything in between.

## Overview

The MICRORACK VCF is a classic 12dB/octave state-variable filter featuring:

- Low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass outputs
- Resonance up to self-oscillation
- CV control of cutoff frequency
- Warm analog character

## Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Filter type | State-variable |
| Slope | 12dB/octave |
| Cutoff range | 20Hz - 20kHz |
| Resonance | 0 to self-oscillation |
| Input level | 5Vpp max |
| Current draw | 10mA |

## Inputs

- **IN**: Audio input
- **CV1**: Cutoff frequency CV (1V/Oct)
- **CV2**: Cutoff frequency CV with attenuator

## Outputs

- **LP**: Low-pass output (removes highs)
- **HP**: High-pass output (removes lows)
- **BP**: Band-pass output (removes highs and lows)

## Controls

- **CUTOFF**: Base cutoff frequency
- **RES**: Resonance amount
- **CV2 AMT**: Attenuator for CV2 input

## Patching Examples

### Classic Subtractive

```
VCO SAW → VCF IN
ADSR → VCF CV1
VCF LP → VCA
```

### Wah Effect

```
AUDIO IN → VCF IN
LFO TRI → VCF CV1
VCF BP → OUT
```

### Self-Oscillating Sine

```
(no input needed)
VCF CV1 ← keyboard CV
VCF LP → VCA
Set RES to maximum
```

## Resonance

Increasing resonance emphasizes frequencies around the cutoff point:

- **Low**: Subtle coloration
- **Medium**: Emphasized harmonics
- **High**: Sharp peak, "wet" sound  
- **Maximum**: Self-oscillation (produces pure sine wave)

## Tips

- Band-pass is great for vocal/formant sounds
- Use envelope → CV for plucky, dynamic sounds
- At high resonance, the filter becomes a sine oscillator
- Chain multiple VCFs for steeper slopes
