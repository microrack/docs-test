# Sound Design

Learn the art and science of synthesis with MICRORACK.

## Subtractive Synthesis Basics

The foundation of most MICRORACK patches:

1. **Start with rich harmonics** (sawtooth or square wave)
2. **Shape with filters** (remove unwanted frequencies)
3. **Add dynamics** (envelopes control amplitude)
4. **Modulate parameters** (LFOs add movement)

## Creating Classic Sounds

### Bass
- Use sawtooth or square wave
- Low-pass filter with moderate resonance
- Short, punchy envelope
- Add filter envelope for punch

### Pads
- Multiple detuned oscillators
- Slow filter sweep
- Long attack and release
- Add chorus or reverb

### Leads
- Bright waveform (saw or pulse)
- Filter with envelope modulation
- Moderate resonance
- Consider portamento

## Sound Design Workflow

1. **Choose oscillator waveform** for tonal character
2. **Set filter type and cutoff** for timbre
3. **Design envelopes** for articulation
4. **Add modulation** for movement
5. **Fine-tune and experiment**

## Experimental Techniques

- Ring modulation for metallic tones
- Noise as modulation source
- Extreme resonance for self-oscillation
- Feedback patches for chaos

## Tips

- Save variations of successful patches
- Document unusual techniques
- Record experiments for later reference
- Share discoveries with the community
