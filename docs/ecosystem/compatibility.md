# Compatibility

MICRORACK is designed to work with other modular synthesizer formats and external equipment.

## Modular Format Compatibility

### Eurorack

MICRORACK can connect to Eurorack systems:

| Aspect | MICRORACK | Eurorack | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Signal level | 5Vpp | 10Vpp | Use level adapters |
| CV range | 0-5V | ±5V | Offset may be needed |
| Power | ±9V | ±12V | Separate power rails |
| Mounting | Breadboard | Rails | Use Rack Chassis |

**Rack Chassis Adapter**: Allows MICRORACK modules to mount in Eurorack cases with proper power conversion.

### AE Modular

Full compatibility via collaboration with Tangible Waves:

- Same pin pitch (2.54mm)
- Similar signal levels
- AE Chassis allows mixing both formats
- Shared design philosophy

### Other Formats

| Format | Compatibility | Method |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Buchla | Partial | CV level conversion |
| Serge | Good | Similar banana-style patching option |
| Moog | Good | 1V/octave compatible |
| Korg MS | Partial | Hz/V requires converter |

## External Equipment

### Audio Interfaces

Connect to recording equipment:

- Line-level output via Jack Output module
- Balanced output adapter available
- Ground loop isolation if needed

### MIDI Controllers

Full MIDI support via ESP32 module:

- USB MIDI input
- Traditional DIN MIDI (with adapter)
- Bluetooth MIDI (experimental)

### CV/Gate Equipment

Compatible with:

- Analog sequencers (Arturia, Korg, etc.)
- CV-equipped keyboards
- Eurorack/Modular outputs
- Arduino/Teensy projects

### Instruments

Process audio from:

- Electric guitars (use high-impedance input)
- Bass guitars
- Microphones (with preamp)
- Line-level sources

## Adapters & Accessories

| Adapter | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Level Shifter | ±5V ↔ ±12V conversion |
| Impedance Matcher | Guitar/mic compatibility |
| MIDI Adapter | DIN ↔ USB conversion |
| Eurorack Power Adapter | 12V rail conversion |
| 3.5mm Jack Adapter | Eurorack patch cable compatibility |
