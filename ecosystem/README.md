# The MICRORACK Ecosystem

MICRORACK is more than just a collection of modules; it is a standardized platform designed for interoperability, education, and creative freedom.

## The Philosophy

The core of MICRORACK is the **breadboard**. By using a standard electronic prototyping tool as our "chassis," we lower the barrier to entry for makers and musicians alike. 

- **Accessibility:** No expensive rails or custom cases required to get started.
- **Transparency:** The signal flow is visible, and the architecture is open.
- **Flexibility:** Mix and match modules, or even build your own circuits right next to them.

## The Standard

To ensure that modules from different creators work together seamlessly, we have established the **MICRORACK Specification**. This covers:

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| **Module Height** | 53mm (2090 mil) |
| **Pin Spacing** | 2.54mm (100 mil) — standard breadboard pitch |
| **Orientation** | Triangular notch at module bottom |
| **Power Rails** | +12V, +5V, GND, -12V |
| **Signal Levels** | ±5V audio (10 Vpp), 0-5V CV/gates |
| **Pitch CV** | 1V/octave standard |
| **Color Coding** | Blue (Input), Red (Output), Black (Utility) |

> **Open Platform:** Any enthusiast or brand can create and distribute compatible modules — as open source or commercial designs.
