# Chassis & Mounting

While MICRORACK works perfectly on a desktop breadboard, we offer several options for more permanent or portable setups.

## Breadboard-Only (Default)

The simplest setup — modules sit directly on a standard breadboard:

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Most affordable | No physical protection |
| Maximum flexibility | Not ideal for transport |
| Easy to reconfigure | Cables can be pulled |

> **Recommended for:** Learning, prototyping, studio use

## AE Modular Chassis

Developed in collaboration with **Tangible Waves** (Robert Langer), the AE Modular Chassis allows you to:

- Mix MICRORACK modules with AE Modular modules
- Use the AE Modular power distribution system
- Benefit from a professional, portable enclosure
- Access the AE Modular ecosystem of modules

<!-- GAP: Confirm AE Modular chassis availability and ordering info -->

> **Partnership:** This collaboration brings MICRORACK to the AE Modular community and vice versa.

## Rack Chassis (Eurorack Integration)

The **Rack Chassis** is a specialized adapter for studio integration:

| Feature | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Format | Standard 19" rack or Eurorack rails |
| Height | 3U |
| Power | Built-in conversion (Eurorack ±12V → MICRORACK compatible) |
| Mounting | Secure breadboard and module retention |

<!-- GAP: Confirm Rack Chassis product status and specifications -->

> **Use case:** Integrating MICRORACK into an existing Eurorack system or studio rack.

## DIY & Community Options

The MICRORACK community has developed various mounting solutions:

| Type | Description | Source |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **3D Printed Cases** | Lightweight, customizable | Community designs |
| **Laser-Cut Acrylic** | Sleek, modern aesthetic | Community designs |
| **Wooden Enclosures** | Classic "boutique" look | Community designs |
| **Travel Cases** | Protective transport | Adapted from tool cases |

> **Find designs:** Check the [Forum](https://forum.microrack.org) for community-shared design files and STL downloads.

## Mounting Considerations

### Power Access
Ensure your enclosure allows easy access to the Power Module and its DC input.

### Ventilation
While MICRORACK modules run cool, enclosed cases should have some ventilation for long sessions.

### Cable Clearance
Leave enough space above modules for patch cables and knob access.

### Portability
For gigging, consider cases with secure latches and foam padding for modules.
